# Shooter 2D

A Shooter 2D written entirely in Javascript. It is using the Canvas API and no external libraries.
The goal of this single level game is to kill all the enemies in the screen by shooting them (wasn't expecting that right?)
If you touch an enemy or a bird's poop you... die...

### Keys
RIGHT ARROW - Move right
LEFT ARROW  - Move left
UP ARROW    - Jump
SPACE BAR   - Shoot

#### Final words
Don't forget to enjoy the special effects when you win!
